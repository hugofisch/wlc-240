wlc-240
=======
This is a simple program to connect to a toy tank called 
WLC-240 from Simulus. The program is an adaptio of the 
MJPEG Decoder v1.2.1 by Brian Peek (http://www.brianpeek.com/).
See the full article at Coding4Fun: http://channel9.msdn.com/coding4fun/articles/MJPEG-Decoder

I used only the MJPEGProcessor and the WinForms example
for my work.


this is version 0.1:
- Get rid of all unused stuff from Brian's code
- Establish the video stream connection
- Add some buttons for the directions (single and sum)
- change the name of the project to wlc-240
